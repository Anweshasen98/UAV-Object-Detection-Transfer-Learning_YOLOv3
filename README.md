# UAV-Object-Detection-Transfer-Learning_YOLOv8
12 samples were selected for both training and testing, and in a 3x4 subplot format, the labels were plotted to verify the format, which followed [x y width height] for bounding box regression. The dataset underwent pre-processing, including standardization, augmentation, and resizing images to a uniform size. Stratified splitting based on the presence of UAVs ensured balanced representation across training, validation, and testing sets. In Task 2b, the objective was to train an object detector capable of accurately localizing UAVs in images. Two different object detection networks were compared: one-stage and two-stage detectors. A YOLO architecture was chosen for one network, prioritizing real-time inference capabilities. The effectiveness of transfer learning strategies was assessed through performance metrics such as detection accuracy, speed, and computational efficiency, aiming to inform decisions for UAV object detection.
